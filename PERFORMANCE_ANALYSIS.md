# Performance Analysis - 77s Compilation Time

## Root Causes Identified:

### 1. **Heavy AI/ML Dependencies (Primary Issue)**
- `@langchain/community` (~50MB+ with transitive deps)
- `@langchain/openai` 
- `@datastax/astra-db-ts`
- `openai` package
- These are pulled into the module graph even if not used on homepage

### 2. **Turbopack Performance on Windows**
- Turbopack still has performance issues on Windows filesystems
- Classic Webpack often faster for cold starts

### 3. **Large Dependency Tree**
- 30+ packages including heavy ones like styled-components
- Multiple UI libraries (@radix-ui, lucide-react)
- Form validation with Zod + react-hook-form

## Solutions Applied:

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Remove Turbopack flag** - Use classic Next.js dev server
2. **Isolate vector DB code** - Ensure it's not imported on critical paths
3. **Dynamic imports for heavy components** - Already implemented
4. **Simplified surprise page** - Reduced component dependencies

### Performance Recommendations:

#### 1. Package.json optimizations:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",  // Remove --turbopack
    "dev:turbo": "next dev --turbopack"  // Optional for testing
  }
}
```

#### 2. Move AI dependencies to devDependencies if not used in production:
- Consider if langchain/openai are actually used
- Move to separate microservice if needed

#### 3. Bundle analysis:
```bash
npm run build
ANALYZE=true npm run build  // If you add bundle analyzer
```

## Expected Improvements:
- **Cold start**: 77s â†’ 15-25s
- **Hot reload**: Should remain fast
- **Production build**: Unaffected

## Long-term optimizations:
1. Split AI features into separate service
2. Use lighter alternatives for simple UI components
3. Implement proper code splitting for route-specific deps
